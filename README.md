# Module 4 Challenge - Python Pandas library

## Background

Welcome to this module challenge focused on data analysis with Python's Pandas library. As a crucial component in various fields, such as data science, machine learning, and business intelligence, practical data analysis involves examining, cleaning, processing, and extracting useful information from large datasets. This assignment provides a hands-on opportunity to develop these skills.

In this challenge, we'll dive into a dataset from a fictional e-commerce company, exploring and analyzing data to address real-world business questions. Your mission will involve identifying top customers, popular product categories, calculating profits, and more. By the end of this task, you'll have a practical understanding of data exploration, transformation, and analysis, preparing you for more complex data scenarios in your future career.

## Before You Begin

1. Create a new repository named `pandas-challenge-1`. Do not add this assignment to an existing repository.
2. Clone the new repository to your computer.
3. Add the downloaded starter files to your local Git repository.
4. Push the changes to GitHub or GitLab.

## Challenge Instructions

### Part 1: Explore the Data

Begin by importing the dataset from the CSV file, then explore it to understand its structure and contents:

- Import the data.
- Examine the column names.
- Gather basic statistics with the `describe` function.
- Explore the data further as needed.

**Questions to Answer with Pandas:**

- What three item categories have the most entries?
- For the category with the most entries, which subcategory has the most entries?
- Identify the five clients with the most entries.
- How many total units did the top client order?

### Part 2: Transform the Data

Transform the data for easier analysis:

- Calculate the subtotal for each line.
- Assume shipping prices based on weight.
- Include a sales tax of 9.25% for the total price.
- Calculate the cost and profit for each line.

### Part 3: Confirm Your Work

Verify your calculations against provided email receipts for three specific orders.

### Part 4: Summarize and Analyze

Use your transformed data to analyze spending by the top 5 clients:

- Calculate total spend, units purchased, shipping price, revenue, and profit.
- Create a summary DataFrame sorted by total profit.
- Format data for presentation, with currency in millions of dollars.
